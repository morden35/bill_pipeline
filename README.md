# Congressional Bills Pipeline

## Dependencies

In order to run the Congressional Bills pipeline, a version of Python 3 must be installed on your machine. Visit [Python's documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest Python version for your machine. I worked in Python 3.9.12 for this project.

The pipeline requires the following modules. These modules are built into [Python's standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) (no need to install if Python 3 is already installed on your machine):
- sys
- json
- math
- os.path

Additionally, the pipeline requires the installation of the requests library. To install, run the following from the command line:
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
