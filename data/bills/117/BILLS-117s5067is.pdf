deaths since 2017 have been attributed to vessel strikes in Canada and of the 33 right whale mortalities occurring between 2017 and 2020, 24 of those whales were confirmed to be attributed to entanglements in Canadian fishing gear and vessel strikes in Canadian waters. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8E197CA739F04906AA8EC2C89D2353B5"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Despite these facts, Monterey
