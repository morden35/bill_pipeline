			<paragraph id="ID462a020859e44f33bcae4e02c662be34"><enum>(1)</enum><text>On May 6, 2006,
			 the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Senate stated on the Senate floor
			 that, <quote>the United States tariff on ethanol operates as an offset to an
			 excise tax credit that applies to both domestically produced and imported
			 ethanol.</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="ID00b6a08d43894ac7a0fd4eeabafeabe2"><enum>(2)</enum><text>On May 9, 2006,
			 the Renewable Fuels Association stated: <quote>the secondary tariff exists as
			 an offset to the tax incentive gasoline refiners receive for every gallon of
			 ethanol they blend, regardless of the ethanol’s origin.</quote>. In May 2008,
			 the Renewable Fuels Association’s Executive Director asserted that <quote>The
			 tariff is there not so much to protect the industry but the United States
			 taxpayer.</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="IDfbe87facb2994fc78dcc831b3cc7e076"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In a letter to
			 Congress dated June 20, 2007, the American Coalition for Ethanol, the American
			 Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn Growers Association, the National
			 Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the National Sorghum Producers, and the
			 Renewable Fuels Association stated that the <quote>(blender) tax credit is
			 available to refiners regardless of whether the ethanol blended is imported or
			 domestic. To prevent United States taxpayers from subsidizing foreign ethanol
			 companies, Congress passed an offset to the tax credit that foreign companies
			 pay in the form of a tariff.</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="ID322f7062224047d9878d0be109264abf"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Food,
			 Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, as contained in the Conference Report to
			 accompany H.R. 2419 in the 110th Congress, proposes to decrease the excise tax
			 credit for blending ethanol from $0.51 to $0.45 per gallon, but extend the
			 $0.54 per gallon temporary duty on imported ethanol, increasing the competitive
			 disadvantage of ethanol imports in the United States marketplace. The
			 legislation would transform a tariff designed to offset a domestic subsidy into
			 a real import barrier of at least $0.09 per gallon.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="IDbacd4a9b49404cf4beebd6f64935163c"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The State of

			 the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, and the
			 Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires the United States to use
			 increasing quantities of <quote>advanced biofuels</quote> that have lifecycle

			 Assessment: Well-to-Wheels Energy Inputs, Emissions, and Water Impacts</quote>,
			 concluded that the direct lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of imported sugar

			 greenhouse gas emissions of corn based ethanol from the Midwest are 15 to 28
			 percent lower than gasoline.</text>
