			<subsection id="IDa1cfd0e73a96435391ec94a530e3c6c6"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Findings</header><text>Congress
			 makes the following findings:</text>
				<paragraph id="IDbe7082cc0d7844ddba53312c8c3db48f"><enum>(1)</enum><text>During World War
			 II, members of the Armed Forces of the United States fought valiantly against
			 the Armed Forces of Japan in the Pacific. In particular, from December 1941
			 until May 1942, members of the Armed Forces of the United States fought
			 courageously against overwhelming Armed Forces of Japan on Wake Island, Guam,
			 the Philippine Islands, including the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor, and the
			 Dutch East Indies, thereby preventing Japan from accomplishing strategic
			 objectives necessary for achieving a preemptive military victory in the Pacific
			 during World War II.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="ID383f67c6681e4b1c8e66fed8e88d6597"><enum>(2)</enum><text>During initial
			 military action in the Philippines, members of the Armed Forces of the United
			 States were ordered to surrender on April 9, 1942, and were forced to march 65
			 miles to prison camps at Camp O'Donnell, Cabanatuan, and Bilibid. More than
			 10,000 people of the United States died during the march (known as the
			 <quote>Bataan Death March</quote>) and during subsequent imprisonment as a
			 result of starvation, disease, and executions.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="IDd560431036814de5a029c0b0f5b5c8db"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Beginning in
			 January 1942, the Armed Forces of Japan began transporting United States
			 prisoners of war to Japan, Taiwan, Manchuria, and Korea to perform slave labor
			 to support Japanese industries. Many of the unmarked merchant vessels in which
			 the prisoners were transported (known as <quote>Hell Ships</quote>) were
			 attacked by the Armed Forces of the United States, which, according to some
			 estimates, killed more than 3,600 people of the United States.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="IDe6e146f86edf451d9e188783168f1202"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Following the
			 conclusion of World War II, the Government of the United States agreed to pay
			 compensation to former prisoners of war of the United States, amounting to
			 $2.50 per day of imprisonment. This compensation, paid from assets of Japan
			 frozen by the Government of the United States, is wholly insufficient to
			 compensate fully such former prisoners of war for the conditions they endured.
			 Neither the Government of Japan nor any corporations of Japan admit any
			 liability requiring payment of compensation.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="IDfb7ab853bde94e178c273b32bb954891"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Other countries,
			 including Canada, the United Kingdom, Isle of Man, Norway, the Netherlands, New
			 Zealand, and Australia have previously awarded such a compensation to their
			 surviving veterans who were captured by the Japanese during World War II and
			 required to perform slave labor. Currently, the United States is the only
			 Western Allied power that has not awarded similar compensation to these
			 distinguished heroes of World War II who were prisoners of war of Japan.</text>
				</paragraph></subsection><subsection id="IDcf9ecaf44b134fd9b62ffa0ada40b36e"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Purpose</header><text>The
			 purpose of this section is to recognize, by the provision of compensation, the
			 heroic contributions of the members of the Armed Forces and civilian employees
			 of the United States who were captured by the Japanese military during World
			 War II and denied their basic human rights by being forced to perform slave
			 labor by the Imperial Government of Japan or by corporations of Japan during
			 World War II.</text>
