<paragraph id="HA193EF37D2E84B1F92B28B0962E1786"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The expiration of the Superfund crude oil, chemical feedstock, and corporate taxes in 1995 has contributed to a funding shortfall and has shifted the burden of cleanup to the general public, which has prevented numerous Superfund sites from receiving new construction funding in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 and slowed the pace of existing cleanups.</text> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="H60A61C37A10B40D9A0387909C9493D34"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Delayed and slowed Superfund cleanup actions magnify public health risks and increase total remediation costs.</text> </paragraph>

<paragraph id="H3B20C4D7A46242709E00D13D8054A00"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Although costs vary from site to site, costs at some sites are substantial and place a greater demand on the Hazardous Substance Superfund resources to clean up contamination.</text> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="HB7C6CD92372E4A91A3525900DC3EED34"><enum>(9)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Environmental Protection Agency generally considers Superfund sites where cleanup costs exceed $50,000,000 to be megasites.</text> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="HD752389FB8704F2C9BA960C2F62C8691"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Megasites typically are among the larger, more complex, and more severely contaminated of sites, presenting the greatest cleanup challenges. As such, megasites are a substantial factor driving future funding needs to clean up hazardous substances under the Superfund program.</text> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="H7D0C40281B18451DB0DB0A84AB9600"><enum>(11)</enum><text>The Environmental Protection Agency commits a large percentage of annual Superfund obligations for long-term ongoing cleanup work at only a few sites. These megasites siphon funding from other Superfund sites and result in construction delays. In fiscal year 2006, 45 percent of funds for Superfund construction and post-construction activities went to only 14 sites.</text> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="HCF6553E1AC44414DA69D6512CA4C28B"><enum>(12)</enum><text>As more megasites move beyond the analysis and design phase into actual construction, funding needs for these sites will increase. The average annual cost per megasite is projected to be at least $140,000,000.</text> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="H69A6FAAAE189481AAC9943200063C18C"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Megasites differ from non-megasites in that they require more resources over the long term to address complexities associated with developing remedies and cleaning up contamination that can cover many square miles and may involve multiple communities, responsible parties, Indian Tribes, or States.</text> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="H4170A0D0CED24FA582BD65E42FF75118"><enum>(14)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">For some megasites there is no ascertainable final remedy because remediation may involve decades of sequential actions, and institutional controls may be required in perpetuity. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than half of the mining sites currently listed on the National Priorities List will require operation and maintenance in perpetuity.</text> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="H074C046F79314ADC0019BC80066B692"><enum>(15)</enum><text>Responsible parties may not be able to fund megasite remediation activities that are anticipated to last for decades or longer. The lack of a dedicated revenue stream raises serious concerns about how a remediation program expected to last for decades, if not centuries, can be successfully implemented.</text> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="HE95FD0F9264944BFAFB82328E953FEE6"><enum>(16)</enum><text>At megasites with no viable responsible parties, the Federal Government pays 90 percent of the construction costs, with the State paying the other 10 percent. Once construction is completed, the State is solely responsible for paying all operation and maintenance costs, a time frame that for many megasites may extend in perpetuity.</text> </paragraph></section>
