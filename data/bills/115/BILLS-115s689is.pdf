 </paragraph></section><section id="id4553bcb17ea04cc390170fe13ec67047"><enum>3.</enum><header>Findings</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Congress finds as follows:</text> <paragraph id="id09676e03c53b45928d8050fd288e6f0f"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women under the age of 54, and the American Cancer Society recommends that women in their 20s and 30s have a clinical breast exam at least every 3 years.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idfa6acb4af9a140888ef6bc6d3fb502b9"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system, but it accounts for only about 3 percent of all cancers in women.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id032c494a78ca4eeb8b9c157595a4af12"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The cancers that most frequently impact women include breast, uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancer, and there were 314,257 new cases of these cancers in 2013.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ide4a298e85aa84966958a5c977149ffab"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Rates of incidence and death for gynecologic cancers by race and ethnicity show that, while for some cancers, like ovarian cancer, the rates of incidence and death are similar among all races, for other cancers, like cervical cancer, women of color have a disproportionate rate of incidence. While the incidence of uterine cancer is higher for White women than for women of color, rates of death for uterine cancer are 2 times higher for Black women than for White women.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ided66ee4cb35e498b9872a53d4cea4b18"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Prevention and cancer screening are the best approaches to protecting women from cancer and ensuring early detection and life-saving treatment. Many deaths from breast and cervical cancers could be avoided if cancer screening rates increased among women at risk. Deaths from these cancers occur disproportionately among women who are uninsured or underinsured.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id174ea88ba11f4469a4cc2e239ebd9135"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Due to enhanced screening, cervical cancer, which used to be the leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States, is now a much more preventable and treatable cancer.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id122762bf118d473a89d6d46b60e1ac8f"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Increased access to education, information, and preventive cancer screening increase women’s ability to survive cancer.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id96C120A941BB45DCB24659FE0F75AD0B"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Women’s health care providers that are primarily engaged in family planning services, such as Planned Parenthood health centers, provide necessary screening tests, education, and information to women, especially women of color who face the highest risks of breast cancer and other gynecologic cancers.</text>
